# Gent - keeper and provider of global agent configuration

## Purpose
### One shared config, not many
Problem: many duplicate configuration files for the ai tools I use. Copy pasting between files to keep my ais up to date.

Centralised configuration for the tools I use
- claude, claude code
- codex, codex cli
- windsurf

Types of configuration:
- rules (prompt extensions)
- mcp servers
- workflows/commands
- (future?) agents

Configuration on two levels:
- global
- project level

### Ruby learning project
I want to learn Ruby, this would be a nice simple starter project
